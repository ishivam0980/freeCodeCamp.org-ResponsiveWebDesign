            <h3>Here's a timeline of Marie Curie's life:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1867</strong> - Born Maria Sklodowska in Warsaw, Poland, during Russian occupation</li>
                <li><strong>1883</strong> - Graduated from gymnasium at age 15 with a gold medal</li>
                <li><strong>1891</strong> - Moved to Paris to study at the University of Paris (Sorbonne)</li>
                <li><strong>1893</strong> - Earned her degree in physics, ranking first in her class</li>
                <li><strong>1894</strong> - Earned her degree in mathematics, ranking second in her class</li>
                <li><strong>1895</strong> - Married Pierre Curie, a French physicist</li>
                <li><strong>1896</strong> - Henri Becquerel discovered radioactivity, inspiring Marie's research</li>
                <li><strong>1898</strong> - Discovered the elements polonium and radium with Pierre</li>
                <li><strong>1903</strong> - Won the Nobel Prize in Physics (shared with Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel)</li>
                <li><strong>1906</strong> - Pierre died in a tragic accident; Marie became the first female professor at the University of Paris</li>
                <li><strong>1911</strong> - Won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of radium and polonium</li>
                <li><strong>1914-1918</strong> - Developed mobile X-ray units during World War I, saving countless lives</li>
                <li><strong>1918</strong> - Became director of the Radium Institute (now Curie Institute) in Paris</li>
                <li><strong>1921</strong> - Toured the United States to raise funds for research</li>
                <li><strong>1934</strong> - Died of aplastic anemia, likely caused by radiation exposure from her research</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Legacy and Impact:</h3>
            <p>
                Marie Curie's groundbreaking research laid the foundation for modern atomic physics and chemistry. Her discoveries led to significant advances in medical treatments, particularly in cancer therapy through radiation. She broke barriers for women in science and remains an inspiration for generations of scientists. Her notebooks, to this day, are still radioactive and will remain so for another 1,500 years.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Beyond her scientific achievements, Marie Curie demonstrated remarkable perseverance in the face of gender discrimination, personal tragedy, and health challenges. She established the importance of rigorous scientific methodology and showed that dedication to pure research could lead to discoveries that benefit all humanity.
